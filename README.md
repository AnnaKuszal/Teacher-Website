[https://teacher-website.herokuapp.com/]

**A project designed and made from scratch, individually and after achieving a Web Developer Bootcamp – for developing skills and to be used by a specific person.**

The project of a personal RWD website of a teacher from a vocational school (see: [http://www.teacherwebsite.ugu.pl] ).
Precisely, it is a refreshed version of a previous website made in 2009 (see: [www.informatyka09.ugu.pl]).
The layout of the new one was based on the client suggestions and preferences. Based on sections structure, it contains a welcome screen, information about the owner, materials for students and recommended videos.

Many elements (menu, buttons, loading screen, modals) are activated with JS code. In the layout there are also **Bootstrap4** elements (carousel, cards) – modified and adjusted to specific preferences.
The project’s styles have been divided into partial files in order to separate logical parts (typography, variables), sections and frequently used components.

The website was made with **HTML, Sass, CSS and JavaScript**. The layout is based on Bootstrap Grid and CSS Flex. It is **mobile first and entirely responsive** – usage of most popular devices breakpoints; JS code fixes elements display problems when window resizing and orientation change. Looks good on mobile devices; tested on random available physical devices.
